**Description** 

User needs to enter the Reference IDs during test execution. For instance, the user needs to pass on the information on Purchase Order ID, Sales Order ID and so on, to next testers as part of End to End testing. This information will need to be updated by key user during test execution.

**Sequence**
- During test execution the reference id can be updated for each step 
- Also the consolidated information on all IDs should be updated part of the comments for every test case. This helps in next user to refer the comments if required
- User needs to add references while marking the test "Ready for Test", in the discussion section tagging the next key user, so that information is cascaded through complete end to end chain. It is good practice, to follow below convention,

       Run<x> Input References -
       <Reference 1>
       <Reference 2>
