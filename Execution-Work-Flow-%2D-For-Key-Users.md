- Test suite will be built and correspondingly the test cases will be assigned to the key users. First test will be set with state "Ok for Test"
- The Key user will be triggered with an email informing key user with State updated "Ok for Test"
- Key User does the test and if the test is passed, he/she updates the next test case field "State - 'Ok for Test'". This will trigger an email communication only to the concerned people (who is assigning and test case who is assigned_to)
